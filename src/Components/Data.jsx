This involved optimizing the database to ensure high performance and scalability to handle large volumes of data. I also integrated several third-party APIs into the application to enhance its functionality and provide a seamless user experience. These APIs were consumed by the app to enable features such as OTP and scheduling sessions with mentors. As the creator of the app's backend, I worked closely with the front-end developers to ensure that the application worked seamlessly across all devices and platforms.I also played a critical role in ensuring the application's security and compliance with industry standards.",
